This is just a raw path of project.

You do not need to install any additional libraries or files to compile. OpenGL is inside!

The basic idea is that pressing the SPACEBAR draws a sprite with random position and colour (in this case a "star") with its own lifetime.
Class "Animator" give it a simple animation for lifetime.
When the lifetime expires, the sprite is drops.
